       " Document(page_content='kordlessagain 9 months ago  \\n             | parent | next [–] \\n\\nI\\'ve looked at LangChain multiple times and there is some cool stuff in there to enable a quick prototype. That said, needing ALL the cool stuff in one particular use is unlikely and trying to figure out what to do when you have a specific requirement might not be worth the learning curve.To illustrate the complexity of this, here\\'s a list of things that you might have to do if implementing a document bot:  1. Handle uploading or storing documents somewhere and keeping track of the location.\\n  2. Handling different document types. Sticking to PDFs for this list.\\n  3. Manually or using the PDF to augment the documents with tags, keyterms, titles, etc.\\n  4. At this point you need somewhere to store the metadata. Maybe a DB or using the vector store.\\n  5. Just dealing with PDFs requires some type of PDF library. Other documents may or may not require an additional library.\\n  6. Extracting text from the PDF with something like pdf2image. Not all PDFs have extracted (selectable) text in them. Also, PDFs have images, which sometimes have text.\\n  7. Doing some sort of OCR is very likely. Think about OCR\\'ing the whole thing to deal with no extracted text/images with text.\\n  8. Assuming that, converting pages to images. Also, consider images have data in them, so extracting an image from the image and running some type of detection on it...\\n  9. Using some OCR model to extract text, or figure out how to extract them from the PDF data.\\n  10. Cleaning up that text, then parsing it cleanly. nltk comes into play here.\\n  11. Fragmentation/windowing of text. How long to create the fragments? Or should it be variable?\\n  12. Using the text to get more text via a prompt to a model. Here we can get additional keyterms, or perhaps a summary or question about the text fragment. (we\\'ll use something we write for prompting the LLM here in a second)\\n  13. Storing the fragment. Most people use a vector database for this now, so we can use Weaviate or Pinecone, or ???. Also, consider a moderate amount of fragments and their vectors can be stored in a pickle format with manual dot products for ranking.\\n  14. Figuring out where you are going to get a user prompt. Assuming the easiest thing, collect input from the user in a command prompt.\\n  15. What to do with the user\\'s prompt once you get it. Do you ask an LLM for more info on the prompt? Or do you just jump to...\\n  16. Embed the user\\'s prompt to get a vector back. (Weaviate does this transparently, but you can easily do it yourself using the ada-002 endpoint from OpenAI)\\n  17. Taking that vector (from the embedding/inference to the embed model) do a comparison to other vectors/text you\\'ve stored.\\n  18. Think about what text is important for a new prompt to the LLM. Should it contain directives? How much reference text from the documents does it need? Is a cosign distance or some approximate nearest neighbor match going to be enough?\\n  19. Think about augmenting the vector search with keyterms that were extracted earlier (by both the PDF itself + any LLM inference step you impelment)\\n  20. Take the text you pull back from wherever you stored the vector/text and then build a long string to stuff into a prompt.\\n  21. Consider some type of template structure for the prompts, so you can tweak them without losing your mind. String templates for files in Python are great for $this.\\n  22. Calling the various LLM endpoints. There are multiple models, in a variety of API endpoints, with tokens usually for auth.\\n  23. Consider you may just want text back from the LLM, or maybe you want it to complete or write a dict or array (in which case you may want to make this configurable). You may want to eval things that the LLM writes too.\\n  24. Consider the LLM (ChatGPT for example) may do a completion that contains a block delimited by ```python or similar.\\n  25. Consider those two things may require different completion endpoints, and some endpoints may be deprecated by the provider later.\\n  26. Think if you need function completion calling. GPT-X supports this, so you need a function and a way to pass that function\\'s parameters to the LLM. \\n  27. Build the prompt and submit it. Don\\'t forget to protect your tokens, using env or config.py files.\\n  28. Take the response and do something with it that makes sense. Maybe give it to the user, or use it to build another prompt.\\n  29. Loop back to interact with the user. If the interaction is complicated, like with Discord integration, you may have to do this asynchronously.\\n  27. Think about storing the interaction for use in building future prompts. Hack this into #15.\\n  28. Always consider optimizing your prompt length.\\n  29. Consider how many tokens you are chewing through doing all this.\\n  30. Consider questions by the user about \"what is on page 2?\" need context. Another good one is \"how many pages is this document\", or \"what is the title of the document?\". A hard one would be \"how many images are in this PDF?\", meaning how many illustrations...\\n  31. If the document discusses code, and the model outputs code, or SQL, do you run it and if you do, how?\\n\\nExample of most of this in action: https://github.com/FeatureBaseDB/DoctorGPT', metadata={'source': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36725982', 'title': 'The Problem with LangChain'}),\n",

As a consequence, and contrary to the classic middleware pattern, the chain goes both ways, up to thhe api call, and down returning the result. The first expr is indeed special. It is in this context a level 0 function: it takes a context, does stuff, and returns the context. The other functions in the threading/-> expression are level 1 function: they return a level-0 function, in short they act like a factory. That returned function will be then threaded into the following level 1 function and so on. In the end the defined 'chatgpt' element is the whole chain.

One of their example is to call an API by letting LLM parse a documentation and call the API from its understanding, which looks so unreliable if the LLM went offs a bit. I found it hard to give total control to Langchain.I tried experimenting on building a library that makes it easy and transparent to use LLM https://github.com/adityapurwa/jehuty and tried the middleware approach that might be more familiar in general.

I can handle all of the agent side of things, I just want relevant source materials from the vector DB as strings — anyone have a better more direct way they recommend?zainhoda 9 months ago  \n",

He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle.\\nBetween 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski murdered three individuals and injured 23 others in a nationwide mail bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment. He authored Industrial Society and Its Future, a 35,000-word manifesto and social critique opposing industrialization, rejecting leftism, and advocating for a nature-centered form of anarchism.In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills to become self-sufficient. After witnessing the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin, he concluded that living in nature was becoming impossible and resolved to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature through terrorism. In 1979, Kaczynski became the subject of what was, by the time of his arrest in 1996, the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) before his identity was known, resulting in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\".\\nIn 1995, Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times promising to \"desist from terrorism\" if The Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary in attracting attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies. The FBI and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of the essay, which appeared in The Washington Post in September 1995. Upon reading it, Kaczynski\\'s brother, David, recognized the prose style and reported his suspicions to the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski—maintaining that he was sane—tried and failed to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wished him to plead insanity to avoid the death penalty. He pleaded guilty to all charges in 1998 and was sentenced to eight consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole. In June 2023, Kaczynski died by suicide in prison.\\n\\n',\n",

The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.MKUltra was revealed to the public in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms's order. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings. Some surviving information about MKUltra was declassified in 2001.\\n\\n\",\n",

The commission issued a single report in 1975, touching upon certain CIA abuses including mail opening and surveillance of domestic dissident groups.

Unclassified information about the MKNAOMI program and the related Special Operations Division is scarce. It is generally reported to be a successor to the MKULTRA project focusing on biological projects including biological warfare agents—specifically, to store materials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to develop devices for the diffusion of such materials.During its first twenty years, the CIA engaged in projects designed to increase U.S. biological and chemical warfare capabilities. Project MKNAOMI was initiated to provide the CIA with a covert support base to meet its top-secret operational requirements. The goal was to have a robust arsenal of lethal and incapacitating materials within the CIA's Technical Services Division (TSD). This would enable the TSD to serve as a center for supplying biological and chemical materials.Surveillance, testing, upgrading and the evaluation of special materials and items were provided by MKNAOMI to ensure that no defects or unwanted contingencies emerged during operational conditions. The U.S. Army's Special Operations Command (SOC) was assigned to assist the CIA with development, testing and maintenance procedures for the biological agents and delivery systems (1952). Both the CIA and SOC modified guns to fire special darts coated with biological agents and poisonous pills. The darts could incapacitate guard dogs, allowing agents to infiltrate the area that the dogs were guarding, and would then be used to awaken the dogs upon exiting the facility. In addition, the SOC was designated to research the potential to use biological agents against other animals and crops.A 1967 CIA memo which was uncovered by the Church Committee contained evidence of at least three covert techniques for attacking and poisoning crops that had been tested under field conditions. On November 25, 1969, President Richard Nixon banned any military use of biological weapons and Project MKNAOMI was dissolved. On February 14, 1970, a presidential order outlawed all stockpiles of bacteriological weapons and nonliving toxins. However, despite the presidential order, a CIA scientist was able to acquire an estimated 11 grams of deadly shellfish toxin from SOC personnel at Fort Detrick. The toxin was stored in a CIA laboratory where it remained undetected for over five years.\\n\\n\",\n",

He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle.\\nBetween 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski murdered three individuals and injured 23 others in a nationwide mail bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment. He authored Industrial Society and Its Future, a 35,000-word manifesto and social critique opposing industrialization, rejecting leftism, and advocating for a nature-centered form of anarchism.In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills to become self-sufficient. After witnessing the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin, he concluded that living in nature was becoming impossible and resolved to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature through terrorism. In 1979, Kaczynski became the subject of what was, by the time of his arrest in 1996, the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) before his identity was known, resulting in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\".\\nIn 1995, Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times promising to \"desist from terrorism\" if The Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary in attracting attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies. The FBI and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of the essay, which appeared in The Washington Post in September 1995. Upon reading it, Kaczynski\\'s brother, David, recognized the prose style and reported his suspicions to the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski—maintaining that he was sane—tried and failed to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wished him to plead insanity to avoid the death penalty. He pleaded guilty to all charges in 1998 and was sentenced to eight consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole. In June 2023, Kaczynski died by suicide in prison.\\n\\n',\n",

Such tests have been performed throughout American history, but some of them are ongoing. The experiments include the exposure of humans to many chemical and biological weapons (including infections with deadly or debilitating diseases), human radiation experiments, injections of toxic and radioactive chemicals, surgical experiments, interrogation and torture experiments, tests which involve mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of other experiments. Many of these tests are performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of \"medical treatment\". In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.\\nMany of these experiments violated US law. Some others were sponsored by government agencies or rogue elements thereof, including the Centers for Disease Control, the United States military, and the Central Intelligence Agency, or they were sponsored by private corporations which were involved in military activities. The human research programs were usually highly secretive and performed without the knowledge or authorization of Congress, and in many cases information about them was not released until many years after the studies had been performed.\\nThe ethical, professional, and legal implications of this in the United States medical and scientific community were quite significant, and led to many institutions and policies that attempted to ensure that future human subject research in the United States would be ethical and legal. Public outrage in the late 20th century over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission, both of 1975, and the 1994 Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, among others.\\n\\n',\n",

He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle.\\nBetween 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski murdered three individuals and injured 23 others in a nationwide mail bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment. He authored Industrial Society and Its Future, a 35,000-word manifesto and social critique opposing industrialization, rejecting leftism, and advocating for a nature-centered form of anarchism.In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills to become self-sufficient. After witnessing the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin, he concluded that living in nature was becoming impossible and resolved to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature through terrorism. In 1979, Kaczynski became the subject of what was, by the time of his arrest in 1996, the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) before his identity was known, resulting in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\".\\nIn 1995, Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times promising to \"desist from terrorism\" if The Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary in attracting attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies. The FBI and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of the essay, which appeared in The Washington Post in September 1995. Upon reading it, Kaczynski\\'s brother, David, recognized the prose style and reported his suspicions to the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski—maintaining that he was sane—tried and failed to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wished him to plead insanity to avoid the death penalty. He pleaded guilty to all charges in 1998 and was sentenced to eight consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole. In June 2023, Kaczynski died by suicide in prison.\\n\\n',\n",

It began in 1953 and was halted in 1973. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals without the subjects' consent, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and other forms of torture.MKUltra was preceded by Project Artichoke. It was organized through the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. The program engaged in illegal activities, including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects.:\\u200a74\\u200a MKUltra's scope was broad, with activities carried out under the guise of research at more than 80 institutions aside from the military, including colleges and universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.MKUltra was revealed to the public in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms's order. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings.

Unclassified information about the MKNAOMI program and the related Special Operations Division is scarce. It is generally reported to be a successor to the MKULTRA project focusing on biological projects including biological warfare agents—specifically, to store materials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to develop devices for the diffusion of such materials.During its first twenty years, the CIA engaged in projects designed to increase U.S. biological and chemical warfare capabilities. Project MKNAOMI was initiated to provide the CIA with a covert support base to meet its top-secret operational requirements. The goal was to have a robust arsenal of lethal and incapacitating materials within the CIA's Technical Services Division (TSD). This would enable the TSD to serve as a center for supplying biological and chemical materials.Surveillance, testing, upgrading and the evaluation of special materials and items were provided by MKNAOMI to ensure that no defects or unwanted contingencies emerged during operational conditions. The U.S. Army's Special Operations Command (SOC) was assigned to assist the CIA with development, testing and maintenance procedures for the biological agents and delivery systems (1952). Both the CIA and SOC modified guns to fire special darts coated with biological agents and poisonous pills. The darts could incapacitate guard dogs, allowing agents to infiltrate the area that the dogs were guarding, and would then be used to awaken the dogs upon exiting the facility. In addition, the SOC was designated to research the potential to use biological agents against other animals and crops.A 1967 CIA memo which was uncovered by the Church Committee contained evidence of at least three covert techniques for attacking and poisoning crops that had been tested under field conditions. On November 25, 1969, President Richard Nixon banned any military use of biological weapons and Project MKNAOMI was dissolved. On February 14, 1970, a presidential order outlawed all stockpiles of bacteriological weapons and nonliving toxins. However, despite the presidential order, a CIA scientist was able to acquire an estimated 11 grams of deadly shellfish toxin from SOC personnel at Fort Detrick.

       "  'summary': 'Theodore John Kaczynski (  kə-ZIN-skee; May 22, 1942 – June 10, 2023), also known as the Unabomber (  YOO-nə-bom-ər), was an American mathematician and domestic terrorist. He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle.\\nBetween 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski murdered three individuals and injured 23 others in a nationwide mail bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment. He authored Industrial Society and Its Future, a 35,000-word manifesto and social critique opposing industrialization, rejecting leftism, and advocating for a nature-centered form of anarchism.In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills to become self-sufficient. After witnessing the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin, he concluded that living in nature was becoming impossible and resolved to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature through terrorism. In 1979, Kaczynski became the subject of what was, by the time of his arrest in 1996, the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) before his identity was known, resulting in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\".\\nIn 1995, Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times promising to \"desist from terrorism\" if The Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary in attracting attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies. The FBI and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of the essay, which appeared in The Washington Post in September 1995. Upon reading it, Kaczynski\\'s brother, David, recognized the prose style and reported his suspicions to the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski—maintaining that he was sane—tried and failed to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wished him to plead insanity to avoid the death penalty. He pleaded guilty to all charges in 1998 and was sentenced to eight consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole. In June 2023, Kaczynski died by suicide in prison.\\n\\n',\n",

However, traditionally Canada has refused to voice any anger even when it was clear that the CIA was operating without any authorisation.Apologists have noted that Canada was vital to CIA operations as it \"physically occupied the territory between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, on May 28, 1975 Solicitor General Warren Allmand directed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to begin investigating the levels of CIA involvement in Canadian affairs.Today, the country continues to cooperate with the CIA, enabling their black sites, allowing ghost planes to land and refuel in Canada, en route to delivering prisoners to unknown locations.

       "  'summary': 'Brainwashing (also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion,  thought control, thought reform, and forced re-education) is the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject\\'s ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into their minds, as well as to change their attitudes, values, and beliefs.The term \"brainwashing\" was first used in English by Edward Hunter in 1950 to describe how the Chinese government appeared to make people cooperate with them during the Korean War. Research into the concept also looked at Nazi Germany and present-day North Korea, at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of human traffickers. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the CIA\\'s MKUltra experiments failed with no operational use of the subjects. Scientific and legal debate followed, as well as media attention, about the possibility of brainwashing being a factor when lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was used, or in the conversion of people to groups which are considered to be cults.Brainwashing has become a common theme in popular culture, especially in science fiction. In casual speech, \"brainwashing\" and its verb form, \"brainwash\", are used figuratively to describe the use of propaganda to persuade or sway public opinion.',\n",

Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra program for the developing of mind control and torture techniques, psychoactive poisons, and behavior modification systems.

       "  'summary': \"Psychology is the study of mind and behavior. Its subject matter includes the behavior of humans and nonhumans, both conscious and unconscious phenomena, and mental processes such as thoughts, feelings, and motives. Psychology is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Biological psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\\nPsychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. They also consider the unconscious mind. Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation.\\nWhile psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings. Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and the media.\",\n",

Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the \"Year of Intelligence\", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee\\'s efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\\nThe most shocking revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA, which involved the drugging and torture of unwitting US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control; COINTELPRO, which involved the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations; and Family Jewels, a CIA program to covertly assassinate foreign leaders.It also unearthed Project SHAMROCK, a program in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA, and officially confirmed the existence of this signals intelligence agency to the public for the first time.\\n\\n',\n",

First came the revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 of the US Army\\'s spying on the civilian population and Senator Sam Ervin\\'s Senate investigations produced more revelations. Then on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the \"family jewels\". Covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.The creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.'"
